# SORTABOT-Mobile C&D Waste Processing Unit   

## Problem Statement 
The rapid increase in **Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste** poses significant environmental challenges, including:  
- **Resource depletion**  
- **Landfill overflow**  

The absence of efficient and scalable on-site solutions for **segregation and recycling** further exacerbates the problem, hindering sustainable urban waste management.  

---

## Project Overview 
We propose a **Mobile and Scalable C&D Waste Processing Unit** designed to revolutionize on-site waste segregation and recycling.  

### Key Features  
- **Efficiency:** Advanced automation for quick and effective material segregation.  
- **Mobility:** Deployable directly to construction sites.  
- **Sustainability:** Supports circular economy practices.  
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces transportation costs and environmental impact.  

This innovative system transforms C&D waste into **reusable resources**, contributing to sustainable urban development.

## Key Wastes Managed  

1. **Metals**  
   - **Ferrous** and **non-ferrous metals** (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum) are separated and sent for recycling into new products.  

2. **Ceramics**   
   - Broken tiles, pottery, and other ceramics are recycled into construction materials.  

3. **Concrete**   
   - Crushed and reused as aggregates in concrete mixes or as filler material.  

4. **Plastics**   
   - Visually sorted and crushed for reuse in manufacturing or industrial applications.  

5. **Wood**  
   - Sorted and repurposed for construction, or processed into wood chips for energy production.

## How It Works 

1. **Waste Preparation** üì¶  
   Incoming waste is pre-sized for easier handling and processing.  

2. **Magnetic Separation** üß≤  
   A **magnetic roller** extracts ferrous materials like metal scraps.  

3. **Optical Sorting** üñºÔ∏è‚û§üóëÔ∏è  
   **Advanced sensors** identify material types (e.g., glass, plastic, wood). Automated mechanisms direct these materials into their respective containers.  

4. **Hard Material Crushing** üõ†Ô∏è  
   Materials like **concrete** and **ceramics** are crushed for size reduction.  

5. **Soft Material Crushing** üå≥üß©  
   **Plastics** and **wood** are separately crushed to uniform sizes.
